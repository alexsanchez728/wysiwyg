## NSS Exercise: What You See Is What You Get


#### Description & Objectives
##### An exercise in using event listeners and DOM traversal
> 1. Create an array of famous people.
> 2. For every even numbered element, have a light yellow background and for every odd numbered, a light blue background.
> 3. When you click on one of the person elements, a dotted border should appear around it.
> 4. When you click on one of the person elements, the text input should immediately gain focus so that you can start typing.
> 5. When there is a highlighted person element, and you begin typing in the input box, the person's biography should be immediately bound to what you are typing, letter by letter.
> 6. When you press the enter/return key when typing in the input field, then the content of the input field should immediately be blank.

Clicking one of the five famous figures will add a border indicating they are selected.
The text field will gain focus and now anything typed into the field will be reflected in the person's biography field.

##### Congratulaitons!!!
You've changed history! Now you hit enter to permanantly leave your mark!

##### Uh Oh,
What you just wrote changes back! As it turns out you can't actually rewrite history.
